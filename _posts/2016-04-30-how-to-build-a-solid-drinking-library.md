  The GUITAR style of Greg Wolfe has been described as “A melding pot of
  influences you can hear like Jimmy Paige, Clapton, Beck, Hendrix, Gilmour,
  Eddie Van Halen, Stevie Ray Vaughen, Randy Rhoads, Paul Gilbert, Joe Satriani,
  Eric Johnson and Steve Vai.....mixed in with his own sprinkling of guitar dust
  that produces the sound that makes his.....well, his” As quoted by Bill Aucoin
  (Manager of KISS, Billy Idol) “I have seen some of the best
  guitarists/performers in my time, and whatever those guys got...he’s got it”
